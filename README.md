# Multi-scale Informative Perceptual Network for Monaural Speech Enhancement
This repo provides a reference implementation of MIPNet as described in the paper: _Multi-scale Informative Perceptual Networks for Monaural Speech Enhancement_
## Data preprocess
100 types of noise are concatenated for training and validation, while 104 types of noise for testing (add 4 unseen noises including real-life noise).
